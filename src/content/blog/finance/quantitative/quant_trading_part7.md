## 1. Brownian Motion in Asset Pricing

### Definition and Role

Brownian motion, or the Wiener process, is a continuous-time stochastic process that models random movements, initially observed by Robert Brown in 1827 for pollen particles in water. In finance, it represents the unpredictable fluctuations in asset prices, driven by countless small, independent factors like market sentiment or economic news. It’s a cornerstone of quantitative finance, particularly for option pricing and risk modeling.

### Mathematical Framework

Asset prices are often modeled using **geometric Brownian motion (GBM)** to ensure prices remain positive, unlike standard Brownian motion which can go negative. The price \( S_t \) evolves according to:
\[
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
\]

- \( S_t \): Asset price at time \( t \)
- \( \mu \): Drift (expected return rate)
- \( \sigma \): Volatility (price variability)
- \( dW_t \): Increment of standard Brownian motion, where \( W_t \sim N(0, t) \)

The increment \( dz_t = \sigma dW_t \) captures the random price change, scaled by volatility. GBM is used in the Black-Scholes model for option pricing, assuming continuous price paths without jumps.

### Applications

- **Option Pricing**: Provides the stochastic component for valuing derivatives.
- **Risk Management**: Simulates price paths to estimate potential losses.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Models asset returns for strategic allocation.

### Example

Consider a stock at $100 with a 5% annual drift (\( \mu = 0.05 \)) and 20% volatility (\( \sigma = 0.2 \)). Over one year, its price path can be simulated using:
\[
S_t = S_0 \cdot e^{(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t}
\]
If \( W_t = 0.5 \), the price might be:
\[
S_1 = 100 \cdot e^{(0.05 - \frac{0.2^2}{2}) \cdot 1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \approx 100 \cdot e^{0.03 + 0.1} \approx 114.14
\]
This shows how Brownian motion drives random price changes.

### Limitations

GBM assumes constant volatility and no price jumps, which may not hold in real markets where volatility fluctuates and news causes sudden shifts ([Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)).

## 2. Poisson Process in Order Arrival

### Definition and Role

A Poisson process models the occurrence of random, independent events over time, such as the arrival of buy or sell orders in a market. It’s widely used in market microstructure to understand order flow dynamics, crucial for market makers who rely on order arrivals to set prices.

### Mathematical Framework

The number of orders \( N_t \) arriving by time \( t \) follows a Poisson distribution with rate \( \lambda \):
\[
P(N_t = n) = \frac{(\lambda t)^n e^{-\lambda t}}{n!}
\]
In trading, the arrival rate \( \lambda \) depends on the bid-ask spread \( \Delta \):
\[
\lambda = A \cdot e^{-k \Delta}
\]

- \( A \): Base arrival rate
- \( k \): Sensitivity to spread
- \( \Delta \): Spread (ask price minus bid price)

A smaller spread increases \( \lambda \), attracting more orders, while a larger spread reduces order flow.

### Applications

- **Order Flow Prediction**: Estimates how often orders arrive, aiding liquidity provision.
- **Market Making**: Helps set spreads to balance order flow and profitability.
- **High-Frequency Trading**: Models price jumps or order bursts ([Poisson Process](https://www.daytrading.com/poisson-processes)).

### Example

A market maker sets a spread of \( \Delta = 0.01 \), with \( A = 10 \) orders per minute and \( k = 100 \). The arrival rate is:
\[
\lambda = 10 \cdot e^{-100 \cdot 0.01} = 10 \cdot e^{-1} \approx 3.68
\]
If the spread widens to \( \Delta = 0.02 \):
\[
\lambda = 10 \cdot e^{-100 \cdot 0.02} = 10 \cdot e^{-2} \approx 1.35
\]
This shows how wider spreads reduce order arrivals, affecting trading strategy.

### Limitations

The model assumes constant rates and independence, which may not hold during market shocks when order arrivals cluster.

---

## 3. Market Maker’s Inventory Management

### Definition and Role

A market maker’s inventory \( q_t \) is the net quantity of shares held, resulting from buy and sell orders. Managing inventory is critical to avoid directional risk, where price movements against the inventory lead to losses.

### Mathematical Framework

Inventory evolves as:
\[
dq_t = dN_b - dN_a
\]

- \( dN_b \): Buy order increments (Poisson process with rate \( \lambda_b \))
- \( dN_a \): Sell order increments (Poisson process with rate \( \lambda_a \))

Market makers aim to keep \( q_t \approx 0 \) to minimize risk.

### Strategies

- **Spread Adjustment**: Widen the ask spread when long (\( q_t > 0 \)) to reduce buying; narrow the bid spread to encourage selling.
- **Order Size Control**: Adjust order sizes to influence order flow ([Market Making](https://www.marketcalls.in/market-microstructure/understanding-market-making-inventory-management-a-traders-guide.html)).

### Example

Starting with \( q_0 = 0 \), a market maker receives 4 buy orders (\( dN_b = 4 \)) and 2 sell orders (\( dN_a = 2 \)):
\[
q_t = 0 + 4 - 2 = 2
\]
To reduce this long position, they might widen the ask spread, making it less attractive for buyers.

### Table: Inventory Scenarios

| **Initial Inventory** | **Buy Orders** | **Sell Orders** | **Final Inventory** | **Action**       |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0                     | 5              | 3               | +2 (Long)           | Widen ask spread |
| 0                     | 2              | 6               | -4 (Short)          | Widen bid spread |
| 0                     | 4              | 4               | 0 (Neutral)         | Maintain spreads |

---

## 4. Cash Account and Profit & Loss (P&L)

### Definition and Role

The cash account \( x_t \) tracks the market maker’s cash flow from transactions. The P&L combines this with the inventory’s market value to assess overall profitability.

### Mathematical Framework

The cash account evolves as:
\[
dx_t = p_a \cdot dN_a - p_b \cdot dN_b
\]

- \( p_a \): Ask price
- \( p_b \): Bid price
- \( dN_a \), \( dN_b \): Sell and buy order increments

The total P&L is:
\[
P\&L_t = x_t + q_t \cdot s_t
\]

- \( s_t \): Current stock price

### Applications

- **Profit Tracking**: Monitors financial performance.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates exposure from inventory ([Market Maker P&L](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)).

### Example

Starting with \( x_0 = 0 \), \( q_0 = 0 \), a market maker executes:

- 3 buy orders at \( p_b = 50 \) (\( dN_b = 3 \))
- 2 sell orders at \( p_a = 51 \) (\( dN_a = 2 \))

Cash account:
\[
x_t = 0 + 51 \cdot 2 - 50 \cdot 3 = 102 - 150 = -48
\]
Inventory:
\[
q_t = 0 + 3 - 2 = 1
\]
With \( s_t = 52 \), P&L is:
\[
P\&L_t = -48 + 1 \cdot 52 = 4
\]
The positive P&L reflects the inventory’s value offsetting the cash loss.

## 5. Monte Carlo Simulation in Trading

### Definition and Role

Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling to model the probability of outcomes in uncertain systems. In trading, it simulates market scenarios to test strategy performance under varying conditions.

### Applications

- **Risk Analysis**: Estimates potential losses or drawdowns.
- **Strategy Optimization**: Tests spread or inventory strategies ([Monte Carlo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp)).

### Example

A market maker simulates 10,000 trading sessions with:

- Random order arrivals (\( \lambda_b, \lambda_a \)).
- Price paths via GBM.
- Spread adjustments.

They analyze the P&L distribution to determine the strategy’s robustness, identifying scenarios with high losses to adjust parameters.

### Table: Simulation Outcomes

| **Scenario**    | **Spread** | **Avg P&L** | **Volatility** |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Constant Spread | 0.01       | $500        | $200           |
| Dynamic Spread  | 0.01–0.03  | $600        | $150           |
| Price Jump      | 0.02       | $300        | $300           |

## 6. Avellaneda-Stoikov Model

### Definition and Role

The Avellaneda-Stoikov model optimizes market maker bid and ask prices, balancing profitability and inventory risk. It dynamically adjusts spreads based on inventory and market conditions.

### Mathematical Framework

The reservation price accounts for inventory skew:
\[
s(q_t, t, T, \sigma^2, \gamma) = q_t \cdot \gamma \cdot \sigma^2 \cdot (T - t)
\]
Optimal spreads:
\[
\delta^- = \frac{1}{2} \gamma \sigma^2 (T - t) + \frac{1}{\gamma} \ln(1 + \frac{\gamma}{\kappa^-})
\]
\[
\delta^+ = \frac{1}{2} \gamma \sigma^2 (T - t) + \frac{1}{\gamma} \ln(1 + \frac{\gamma}{\kappa^+})
\]

- \( \gamma \): Risk aversion
- \( \kappa^- \), \( \kappa^+ \): Order arrival parameters

### Applications

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjusts quotes in real-time.
- **Inventory Control**: Reduces risk from large positions ([Avellaneda-Stoikov](https://www.hummingbot.org/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/)).

### Example

With \( q_t = 5 \), \( \gamma = 0.1 \), \( \sigma^2 = 0.04 \), \( T - t = 1 \), \( \kappa^- = \kappa^+ = 1 \):
\[
s = 5 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 1 = 0.02
\]
\[
\delta^- = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.1 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{0.1} \ln(1 + \frac{0.1}{1}) \approx 0.002 + 0.953 = 0.955
\]
The market maker sets asymmetric spreads to reduce inventory.

## 7. Fundamental Rules of Market Making

### Core Principles

Market makers ensure liquidity while managing risk. Key rules include:

1. **Inventory Management**: Adjust spreads to balance inventory.
2. **Risk Management**: Widen spreads during high volatility.
3. **Liquidity Provision**: Maintain continuous quotes.
4. **Profit from Spreads**: Earn from bid-ask differences.
5. **Adaptability**: Respond to market changes ([Market Making Rules](https://www.imc.com/in/articles/what-is-a-market-maker)).

### Example

For a long inventory, a market maker widens the ask spread from 0.01 to 0.02, reducing buy orders and encouraging sales to neutralize the position.

## 8. Performance Metrics for Trading Strategies

### Key Metrics

- **Average Daily P&L**: Daily profit/loss.
- **Volatility**: P&L variability.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return.
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest equity drop.
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit/loss ratio ([Performance Metrics](https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/trading-performance/)).

### Example

A strategy with $10,000 profit, $4,000 loss, 60% win rate, and $1,500 max drawdown has:
\[
\text{Profit Factor} = \frac{10,000}{4,000} = 2.5
\]
\[
\text{Win Rate} = 60\%
\]
These metrics indicate a profitable, stable strategy.

### Table: Strategy Metrics

| **Metric**    | **Value** | **Interpretation**        |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Avg Daily P&L | $200      | Consistent profitability  |
| Volatility    | $50       | Moderate risk             |
| Sharpe Ratio  | 1.5       | Good risk-adjusted return |
| Max Drawdown  | $1,500    | Acceptable loss           |
